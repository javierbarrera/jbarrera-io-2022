# The Goal
In the summer of 2016 I left the company I co-founded to work in the 'enterprise' after almost 6.5 years of being self-employed. One of the benefits of being self-employed is that you get to choose what types of projects you work on, the clients you want to work with, and the technologies are the best choice for your clients. Although I continue to learn software development, I haven't spend the time to experiment and learn at the pace that I did since then. My focus the past couple of years has been learning and practicing agile values and methodologies (where applicable), understanding better team topologies, and thinking how teams can build better architectural runways.

Coming back to my roots and passion as a creator, I feel it's very important to build my software development muscles. I've worked with numerous teams over the past few years as a lead, architect, strategist, and most recently a dedicated Scrum Master. Maintaining development skills will be necessary for me to continue to be happy, and I think the The [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/about/) Challenge is a step in the right direction. Getting back into development has the following benefits for my current role:
- Helps me understand and empathize with developers
- Foresee obstacles [(muda, mura, mudi)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System)
- Work with my teams and suggest change that will help the organization more effectively deliver
- Move up and down the [Architect Elevator](https://martinfowler.com/articles/architect-elevator.html) as I progress my career

When striving to be agile, a rough plan to start will help you keep your focus and maintain a vision on the goal. My goal is to take and pass the [AZ-204: Development Solutions for Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-204) this year. I've taken the test areas and broken them down into 1 week learnings. In total this roadmap adds up to 91 days and I believe it's ambitious. As I go through this challenge, I'll refine my plan and adapt but I would like to take and pass my exam by December, 2021.

My initial plan is to build a [Shopify App](https://shopify.dev/apps/getting-started) that rewards kids (with guardian permission) who complete and keep up on chores. I would like to utilize our Subscription APIs and iOS Buy SDK building along with development on Azure services. Some of this may end up being a shot in the dark, but I do believe this journey will help me solidify how and when to use this technology as I progress on my journey.

I would like to thank Microsoft for the free voucher credit that I received by completing the ["Microsoft Ignite App Maker Challenge."](/posts/microsoft-ignite-app-maker-challenge)
