# The Microsoft Power Platform

Microsoft Ignite just wrapped up with a number really cool capabilities built into the [Microsoft Power Platform](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2020/09/22/announcing-microsoft-power-platform-and-dynamics-365-updates-at-microsoft-ignite/).

I started to re-ignite my interest in low code tools after someone close to me built a Power App this summer in a matter of days. The application she built was previously estimated to take months and hundreds of thousands of dollars in the form of a traditional IT project. While the Power App that she created isn't comparable 1:1 to a custom app, there is tremendous value in building a rapid prototype to test a hypothesis.

After seeing some of the new features and being inspired by the above story, I really wanted to learn more about these tools. I took the [Microsoft Ignite App Maker Challenge](https://csc.docs.microsoft.com/ignite/registration) to give me a high level view of what the Power Platform could offer.

In a little over 7 days, I completed 9 modules (definitely took my time) and felt that I got a great introduction. Some of my favorite takeaways were:

### Data Subject Rights (DSR) requests for Power Apps Customer Data

Global organizations I've worked with have been required to comply with GDPR (May 2018) and CCPA (January 2020). The amount of effort that these organizations went through to ensure compliance was no easy task. Power Apps makes compliance easier, though [considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-gdpr-dsr-guide) still need to be made as you build and connect your app. Systems thinking required.

Customer privacy is important, and as more states enact laws (potentially using CCPA as a blueprint) we all need to ensure that compliance is built-in across the enterprise.

### Power Automate

Power Automate could be described as the [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) of the Power Platform World - though it's much more. There are over 220 services that can connect to, with special attention to Microsoft Technologies. While I think there are a great number of ways to use this, the advantage of using this for RPA (Robotic Process Automation) is what really excites me.

### AI Builder

AI Builder lets you do a number of things from analyzing text, predicting when something will happen, process text from images, and reading and saving information from documents. AI Builder works in Power Apps and Power Automate, and is what truly can enable RPA.

## The Value of Prototyping

As an Agilist, I believe the [12 agile principals](https://www.scrumalliance.org/resources/agile-manifesto) can help organizations realize and discard opportunities as they show up. Low code tools allow for more rapid prototyping so that you can build, test, and evolve ideas. The Microsoft Power Apps platform is one such tool that can help your organization validate prospective solutions, when 'build' is the better option.
